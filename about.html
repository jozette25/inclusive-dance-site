      <h2>About Our Studio</h2>
      <p>
        Inclusive Dance Studio was founded with a simple yet powerful belief: that dance should be accessible to everyone, regardless of ability, background, or experience level. Our mission is to celebrate diversity through movement and foster an environment where all dancers feel empowered to express themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        We prioritize accessibility by offering adaptive instruction, sensory-friendly classes, and inclusive choreography that embraces different learning styles and physical needs. Whether you're a seasoned dancer or just starting your journey, youâ€™ll find a supportive, creative community here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team is passionate about inclusive education and trained in trauma-informed, ability-conscious teaching practices. We strive to lead with compassion, encourage exploration, and celebrate each dancer's unique voice and movement story.
