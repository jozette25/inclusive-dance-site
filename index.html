    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>This website is dedicated to promoting inclusive practices in dance education. We believe that dance is for every body, and we aim to create a space where educators, families, and students can learn about adaptive movement strategies, equity, and accessibility in dance.</p>

    <h2>Why Inclusive Dance?</h2>
    <p>Inclusive dance allows people of all abilities to experience the joy of movement. By adapting dance instruction to meet diverse needs, we foster creativity, confidence, and community in every dancer.</p>
